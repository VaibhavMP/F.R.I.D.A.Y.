# F.R.I.D.A.Y.
Female Replacement Intelligent Digital Assistant Youth
The evolution of AI from a sophisticated helper (J.A.R.V.I.S.) to a hyper-specialized, combat-ready operational partner.
Since F.R.I.D.A.Y. is highly visual, we will build a single, complete HTML application that looks like a futuristic Heads-Up Display (HUD) and integrates the necessary services (Firebase for memory and the Gemini API for intelligence and voice).
Protocol: Proactive AI Tactical Assistant
🚀 Project Overview - 
This project is a modern implementation of Tony Stark's F.R.I.D.A.Y. (Female Replacement Intelligent Digital Assistant Youth), representing the evolution of AI from a sophisticated helper (J.A.R.V.I.S.) to a proactive, tactical, and memory-aware operational partner.
Unlike standard conversational AIs, the F.R.I.D.A.Y. Protocol is built to anticipate user needs, operate on persistent memory, and provide real-time, grounded intelligence. The entire application is contained within a single index.html file, incorporating all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🛠️ Technology Stack - 
This project is entirely contained in a single file, leveraging modern web and AI services.
Frontend: HTML5 and JavaScript (ES Modules)
Styling: Tailwind CSS (for a responsive, futuristic Heads-Up Display aesthetic)
Core Intelligence (LLM): Gemini API (gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025) for Natural Language Understanding (NLU), sophisticated reasoning, and text generation.
Real-Time Data: Google Search Grounding integrated with the LLM to ensure all responses are current and factual.
Speech Interface: Gemini TTS API (gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts) for realistic Text-to-Speech output.
Persistent Storage & Authentication: Firebase Firestore (for memory) and Firebase Auth (for securing user data under a unique User ID).

💻 Getting Started - 
The entire application is deployed via a single file (index.html).
Prerequisites
A modern web browser.
An environment that provides necessary Firebase configuration and a secure authentication token (e.g., the Google AI Studio environment or a locally configured Firebase project).
